I'd seen many printed popular place such as Eiffel, Pyramid but I'd never saw Pisa before. So I do it. Because of being amateur to this, it took a couple of week to finish it. I almost fixed the model every day, the topology is kinda mess. I also didn't know any trick, so some part of it seem a bit off. </p>
